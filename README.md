<h1> This is Icarus</h1>

<h2>Final site address</h2>
https://sammydartnall10.github.io/ucd-icarus/

<h2>About this page</h2>
<h3> This webpage is made for the first code institue module  </h3>

Made as a means of promoting the existing band, Icarus, it consists of:
An index page, with the band name and current/past event listings. 
Music linking to youtube videos is on the second page. 
News, pictures and blog posts can be found under the blog page, and a contact form is availble to send messages to the band. 
The 'send' functionality of the form is not yet active, as it is not a required part of the assessment, however a confirmation page has been created to reflect the behaviour of the form. 

Bootstrap has been used to structure the page, and provide features such as a jumbotron (see blog page).
This has then been styled using my own CSS to change font, colour and look and feel of the site. 

<h2>UX</h2>
This site is designed for and aimed at a variety of users.

Fans of the band will have heard of and know the band already, and have the main goal of wanting to hear recent releases, keep up to date with news and find out when they are next playing. 

Other artists that have heard the band and are interesed in collaborating will need a means to contact the band with such requests. 

Promoters and managers wanting to hire the band for gigs/festivals will need a means to hear the music they play, and also a means to get in touch if they like what they hear. 

New listeners that that are looking to find out more about the band will be looking to hear more music, and find out about the band, current news and where they are playing. 

The architecture of the site is as follows:

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Features Left to Implement
Another feature idea
Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
