<h1> Welcome to my webpage</h1>

<h3> This webpage is made for the first code institue module  </h3>

It contains an index page, with the band name and current/past event listings. 
Music linking to youtube videos is on the second page. 
News, pictures and blog posts can be found under the blog page, and a contact form is availble to send messages to the band. 
The 'send' functionality of the form is not yet active, as it is not a required part of the assessment, however a confirmation page has been created to reflect the behaviour of the form. 

Bootstrap has been used to structure the page, and provide features such as a jumbotron (see blog page).
This has then been styled using my own CSS to change font, colour and look and feel of the site.
